Setting: Racumen's Lair, the stronghold of the Warlock serves as the main setting for the entirety of the story.

General Flow: Main character (you) must venture throughout the castle to find Racumen and eventually defeat him. Along the way are various NPCs you are able to interact with, some friendly, some not.
